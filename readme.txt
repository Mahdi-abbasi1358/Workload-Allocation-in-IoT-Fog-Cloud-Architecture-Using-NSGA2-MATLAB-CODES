With the rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, data volumes have been considerably increased. The processing resources of IoT nodes cannot cope with such huge workloads. Processing parts of the workload in clouds could solve this problem, but the quality of services for end-users will be decreased. Given the latency reduction for end-users, the concept of processing in the fog devices, which are at the edge of the network has been evolved. Optimizing the energy consumption of fog devices in comparison with cloud devices is a significant challenge. On the other hand, providing the expected-quality of service in processing the requested workloads is highly dependent on the propagation delay between fog devices and clouds, which due to the nature of the distribution of clouds with the different workloads, is highly variable. To date, none of the proposed solutions has solved the problem of...
